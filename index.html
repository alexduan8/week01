		<h3>Ways of Seeing Reading Response</h3>
    <p>After watching the video, I didn’t realize how much images and art pieces can be affected by multiple factors. For example, I would think that obvious ones like sound and camera movements would affect an art piece but I wouldn’t have thought that the context in which you view an image would affect how you think of it. For example for me specifically I wouldn’t have thought seeing an original piece in person would change how I feel compared to seeing a copy of it. A specific moment that jumped out to me was when he had the us view the van gogh painting of the crows in silence then he told us it was the last painting he did before he killed himself. Suddenly I could feel the meaning of the painting just change for me. At first I was appreciating the crows taking off and a normal image of the nature of crows. However after knowing the new piece of information I felt like the crows taking off represent van gogh himself and how he is leaving life and letting go. This one example shocked me because I could actually feel and experience what he said in the video.</p>
